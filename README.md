# Diego J’s talks repository


## What’s this?

Spanish version [here](LEEME.md)

Here you’ll found the talks I have given about many topics during my free time.

Contact me if you’re interested in more information about them.

I warn you that many of these talks are in Spanish, so maybe you won’t be able to understand them.

## Disclaimer

The points of view that appear in these presentations are only mine and won’t be the same than my current or past employers.

Any legal advice given in these slides must not be taken (in any way) as actual legal advice because the author (Diego J. Romero López) is not a lawyer. If you need some actual legal advice, talk to a registered lawyer in your country, region or state.

I declare myself fully exempt of responsibility of any harm you suffer or cause by following any of the suggestion or ideas contained in any of these talks.

Any image that appears here is used without the permission of the author but in a fair use way because I don’t make any profit of this. However, if you don’t want your pictures or photos in one of the talk slides, please, contact me by email at diego-j_romero-l-opez__at_g-mail.com (remove the - and _ and replace at with @). I will remove them as soon as possible.
