# Disclaimer

The points of view that appear in these presentations are only mine and won’t be the same than my current or past employers.

Any legal advice given in these slides must not be taken in any way as a legal advice because the author (Diego J. Romero López) is not a lawyer. If you need some actual legal advice, talk to a registered lawyer.

Any image that appears here is used without the permission of the author but in a fair use way. If you don’t want your pictures or photos in one of the talk slides, please, contact me by email at diego-j_romero-l-opez__at_g-mail.com (remove the - and _ and replace at with @).
